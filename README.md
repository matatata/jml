# JML

An experimental Java-Interpreter for a functional language inspired by SML

This is a toy project I've developed to learn more about functional programming languages and particularly [Standard ML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_ML). Although this interpreter lacks some key features of SML like compile-time type checking and type inference, I've implemented much of the language's core features and added means to interact with Java-Objects.
